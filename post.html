              <p>
                Where I live, in southwest Germany, there are a bewildering
                number of shoe stores that specialize in barefoot-style
                footwear. I’ve counted at least four Barfußschuhläden within a
                mile of my home.
              </p>
              <p>
                I’ve asked my local friends about this, and they shrug and say
                things like “Freiburg is an eco-city” or “People here like to
                feel close to nature.”
              </p>
              <p>
                I’d noticed. Last weekend, my kids and I were walking in the
                Black Forest when we passed a woman hiking barefoot. My
                eight-year-old is an inveterate gawker, and he stopped and
                stared at her as though she were insane. Patiently, smilingly,
                she explained to him the pleasures of walking barefoot,
                especially outdoors.
              </p>
              <p>
                That encounter motivated me explore the latest peer-reviewed
                research on minimalist shoes and barefoot walking. After a few
                hours of reading, I started to think I was the crazy one for
                binding up my poor feet in thick layers of leather, rubber, and
                molded plastic.
              </p>

              <div class="special-text-box">
                A 2021 study found that people who switched to minimalist shoes
                for six months increased their foot strength by nearly 60%.
              </div>

              <p>
                Kristiaan D’Août, PhD, is a senior lecturer in evolutionary
                biomechanics at the University of Liverpool in the U.K. He has
                published more than a dozen papers on barefoot locomotion and
                barefoot-style footwear.
              </p>

              <p>
                When we spoke earlier this week, he told me that more work is
                needed to iron out the pros and cons of barefoot running. But
                when it comes to walking, it’s clear that more of us should
                spend time each day barefoot or in minimalist footwear.
              </p>

              <p>
                The problems with conventional shoes are numerous and
                well-documented.
              </p>

              <p>
                There’s the raised heel, which
                <a
                  href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Emma-Cowley/publication/215778008_The_Effect_of_Heel_Height_on_Gait_and_Posture/links/53e9e6e30cf2dc24b3cae874/The-Effect-of-Heel-Height-on-Gait-and-Posture.pdf"

                has linked to both discomfort and assorted injuries. Most shoes
                are also too narrow, especially in the toe box, which D’Août
                says compresses the foot and over time can cause bunions and
                other deformities. Many shoes provide arch support, which seems
                useless — at best. “The idea that the arches of healthy people
                need supporting is something I’ve never found any evidence for,”
                he says. “Based on our anatomy, it’s probably a bad thing.”
              </p>

              <p>
                He mentions an influential
                <a
                  href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature08723?ref=nf"
                  class="post-ref-link"

                from an evolutionary biologist at Harvard, Daniel Lieberman,
                PhD. That study concluded that a more natural running style,
                facilitated by running barefoot or in minimalist shoes, could
                “protect the feet and lower limbs from some of the
                impact-related injuries now experienced by a high percentage of
                runners.”
              </p>
              <div class="special-text-box">
                Running aside, most of us would benefit from a daily walk
                barefoot or in minimalist footwear.
              </div>
              <p>
                Separately, there are those who believe barefoot contact with
                the ground — often referred to as “grounding” or “earthing” —
                may provide important health benefits.
              </p>
              <p>
                When it comes to running on flat, hard surfaces — something that
                may be good for your heart and overall health but ultimately bad
                for your feet and joints — researchers are still debating
                whether barefoot or minimalist footwear is superior to
                conventional running shoes. For runners, the “right” style of
                shoe may vary depending on a person’s weight, age, running
                habits, and injury history.
              </p>
              <p>
                f you want to run in barefoot-style shoes — or just plain
                barefoot — D’Août says you should make the change gradually.
                “Start with one session a week and make it really short, just
                five-to-10 minutes,” he advises. From there, you can work your
                way up to longer or more intense runs. “The older you are and
                the more vigorous the activity, the more you need to take it
                slow,” he says.
